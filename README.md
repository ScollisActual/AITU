# AITU Project

## Overview
This project will deliver a full-stack tracking solution that combines custom-built hardware, cellular GPS connectivity, and a secure cloud backend. The system will gradually evolve as time allows, collecting, transmitting, and analyzing location data in real time.

## Key Features
- **Custom Hardware**: PCB design, component soldering, and embedded firmware development.
- **Cellular + GPS**: Real-time location reporting over LTE-M/NB-IoT with GNSS.
- **Cloud Backend**: Secure data ingestion, storage, and scoring logic.
- **Web Dashboard**: Mapping, geofencing, scoring, and analytics interface.
- **Analytics Engine**: Reliability scoring, anomaly detection, and historical replay.

## Status
This is a personal, incremental project built in spare time. Work will be tracked via GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and Project boards.
